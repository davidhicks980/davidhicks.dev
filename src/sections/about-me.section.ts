My development experience has mostly involved Typescript alone or with Angular, but I am always looking for new languages and paradigms that I can use to create helpful tools.

Where they share terrain is in their complexity, which can make designing software (that pharmacists enjoy using) enormously difficult. As a result, medical software can be more harmful than helpful, with <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/on-call/alert-fatigue">alert fatigue</a>,

Over the past year, I've also become invested in RxJS, and have learned some Python for shorter scripts and web scraping.
