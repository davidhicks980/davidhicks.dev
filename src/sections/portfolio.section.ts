            Built for students at the Eshelman School of Pharmacy, the
            pharmacokinetics component project was aimed at creating interactive

            ElderDrug.com is an Angular project aimed at making Beers Criteria
            -- a list of Beers Criteria. Additionally, Elder Drug expands index
            terms to include brands and generics for all entries, even those
            that only specify a class or therapeutic category (e.g.
            'Antipsychotics' would include 'aripiprazole' and 'Abilify'). Many
            drugs in this database have been determined by querying
            Class/Therapeutic Category members (e.g. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors),
            and using the resulting generic RxCUIs to query brand names.
